# Introduction
==============

Welcome to my Durandal playground.  I'm using this to spike an implementation of Durandal with Nancy, and Bootstrap to start.

I'll probably be adding some signalr, mass transit, eventstore, and MongoDB bits as time permits.

Keep in mind, this is NOT an exercise in software patterns, although every attempt is made to follow sound software development principles
